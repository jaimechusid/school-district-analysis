# School District Analysis

## Overview of Project
In this project, Maria, a data scientist, has given me the task of analyzing scores from standardized testing in both math and reading to provide insights on performance trends and patterns. I was asked to create tables displaying the following metrics to complete this analysis.

1. All of the district's key metrics.
2. Key metrics for each school in the district.
3. Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate.
4. The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school.
5. The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school.
6. School performance based on the budget per student.
7. School performance based on the school size.
8. School performance based on the type of school.

## Results
